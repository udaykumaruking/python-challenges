- **Problem 1** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number. **Completed**
- **Problem 2** - If a sentance contains every letter in the English alphabet **Completed**
- **Problem 3** - As tring contains only characters '(' and ')' find the length of longest valid parentheses substring. **Completed**
- **Problem 4** - Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. **To-Do**
- **Problem 5** - Implement The function accepts two positive integers ‘m’ & ‘n’ as its arguments. You are required to calculate the sum of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 between the inclusive range of m and n.
- **Problem 6** - The function accepts integers 'dir', 'd1', 's1', 'd2' and 's2' as its argument. 'd1' & 'd2' are the distances and 's1' & 's2' are the speeds of first and second person respectively. Implement the function to find 'time1' and 'time2', which is the time taken by 1st and 2nd person respectively and return relative time as per given conditions :
  if dir = 0, relative time = time1 + time2
  if dir = 1, relative time = time1 - time2
  Also, time = distance/speed
  Assumption :
  tim1 >= time2
  d1, d2, s1, s2 are greater than 0.
  dir is either 1 or 0.

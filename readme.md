## <a name="numbers">Numbers</a>

**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go. \_\_To - Do--

**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number. \_\_To - Do--

**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them. \_\_To - Do--

**Mortgage Calculator** - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. \_\_To - Do--

**Change Return Program** - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change. \_\_To - Do--

**Binary to Decimal and Back Converter** - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent. \_\_To - Do--

**Calculator** - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity. \_\_To - Do--

**Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more)** - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion. \_\_To - Do--

**Alarm Clock** - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time. \_\_To - Do--

**Distance Between Two Cities** - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude. \_\_To - Do--

**Credit Card Validator** - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum). \_\_To - Do--

**Tax Calculator** - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax. \_\_To - Do--

**Factorial Finder** - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion. \_\_To - Do--
